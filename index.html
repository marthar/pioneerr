            <p>This onsite/online hybrid course is geared towards students interested in exploring augmented and virtual reality-based experiences for journalistic, experimental and artistic experiences. During the first half of the course, students are introduced to the the theory and history of these technologies and an array of tools used to prototype and design for AR/VR. In the 2nd half of the course, students will create an original ar/vr experience. They are encouraged to be playful but critical, and explore the limitations and best practices of the technologies.</p>
            <p>Bring your PC or Mac laptop. No prerequisites. We will explore Unity, A-frame, and current platforms.</p>
            <p id="register">All Monday classes are online with the exception of the first class which is at MassArt. Wednesday classes are on-site.</p>
