                <p>In Pursuit of Happiness is an augmented reality poster exhibition featuring more than 50 letter-pressed American presidential campaign slogans. Augmented reality brings to life the sometimes-unsettling and often-preposterous words of American political leaders from the past 200 years. As a whole, the posters portray the evolution of American values and inject a bit of humor into our current political climate.</p>

            <p><b>What is Augmented Reality?</b></p>
            <p>Augmented reality is a technology that allows us to use our smartphones to overlay digital information into the physical environment to augment, or enhance what one sees, hears and feels.</p>
            <p>With the Artivive App (free download for Android and IOS) and their smartphone camera, gallerygoers can initiate a unique augmented reality experience for each of the designated posters, enabling us as artists to share more of the story behind the slogans.</p>
